    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",

      "The \"best\" way to write a loop in Python often depends on the specific use case and the type of data you're working with. However, here are some common and effective ways to write loops in Python, along with examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Using `for` loop\n",
      "The `for` loop is commonly used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Loop through a list\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Using `while` loop\n",
      "A `while` loop continues until a specified condition is no longer true. Ensure you update the condition within the loop to avoid infinite loops!\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Loop until a condition is met\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Using `enumerate` for index tracking\n",
      "If you need both the index and the value from a list, `enumerate` can be very useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Loop with index\n",
      "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. List comprehensions\n",
      "For cases where you want to create a new list from an existing one, consider using a list comprehension for concise and readable code.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Creating a new list with a comprehension\n",
      "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "print(squares)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Using `break` and `continue`\n",
      "These statements allow you to control the flow of the loop. Use `break` to exit the loop early and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Using break and continue\n",
      "for number in range(10):\n",
      "    if number == 5:\n",
      "        break  # Exit the loop if number is 5\n",
      "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
      "        continue  # Skip to the next iteration if the number is even\n",
      "    print(number)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "- **Keep it simple**: Write loops that are easy to read and understand.\n",
      "- **Limit complexity**: Avoid nesting too many loops unless absolutely necessary.\n",
      "- **Be mindful of performance**: For large datasets, consider more efficient algorithms or use libraries like NumPy or pandas when appropriate.\n",
      "\n",

      "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to a tendency for CEOs or startup founders to hire executives who are weak in their respective areas of expertise. This situation often occurs when a CEO, who has experience in a particular function (such as product management, sales, or marketing), hires someone less competent in that function. The underlying issue is that the CEO struggles to let go of the function that initially contributed to their success, which leads them to choose a weaker candidate so they can remain the predominant authority in that area. This concept is illustrated through the example of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite being a successful TV network executive, failed to effectively manage ABC after acquiring it, ultimately stating, “If I had an extra two days a week, I could turn around ABC myself.” This indicates the challenges and misjudgments that can arise from such hiring decisions.\n",

It focuses on enhancing retrieval quality through pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies, refining indexing techniques, and employing optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process. Despite these enhancements, it maintains a chain-like structure similar to Naive RAG.\n",

      "3. **Modular RAG** represents an advancement beyond the previous two paradigms, offering greater flexibility and adaptability. This approach incorporates diverse strategies for improving various components, introduces additional specialized modules, and allows for integrated end-to-end training across its components.

      "   - Query expansion\n",

Specifically, KGs are portrayed as composed of nodes (which represent paragraphs or structures within documents, such as pages and tables) and edges (that indicate semantic or lexical similarities between paragraphs or relationships within the document structure). This construction of KGs helps effectively address knowledge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document environment, enhancing the overall efficiency of the RAG system (Source 3). \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Integration with Long Context**: As LLMs (Large Language Models) are capable of managing contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens, discussions arise concerning the necessity of RAG in scenarios where LLMs can incorporate entire documents. Despite this, RAG is highlighted as still having an irreplaceable role due to factors such as inference speed and operational efficiency when using chunked retrieval and on-demand input.\n",

      "2. **Operational Efficiency**: Exploring how to enhance the efficiency of retrieval-based processes while ensuring that the entire retrieval and reasoning process remains observable, thus allowing users to verify generated answers.\n",

      "3. **Complex Problem Solving**: The expansion of context presents new opportunities for RAG to tackle more complex problems and integrative or summary questions that require the processing of larger amounts of material for accurate answers.\n",
